# Scheduler Microservice

A production-grade microservice for scheduling jobs with configurable intervals and persistence. This service provides RESTful APIs for job creation, retrieval, and listing.

---

##  Features

 **Job Scheduling:**  
Create jobs with cron-like schedules (e.g., every Monday at 9 AM).

 **API Endpoints:**
- `POST /jobs` ‚Äì Create a new job.
- `GET /jobs` ‚Äì List all jobs.
- `GET /jobs/{id}` ‚Äì Retrieve job details.

 **Persistence:**
- Jobs stored in a relational database (SQLite for demonstration, easily replaceable with PostgreSQL/MySQL).

 **Background Execution:**
- Jobs run automatically using APScheduler.

 **Interactive API Documentation:**
- Swagger UI available at `/docs`.

##  Project Setup

Follow these steps to set up and run the service locally:

1Ô∏è **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd scheduler_service

2. python -m venv venv
3. venv\Scripts\activate
4. pip install -r requirements.txt
5. uvicorn app.main:app --reload


## Scalability Overview (One-Pager)
This microservice is designed to scale horizontally and handle high workloads:

1Ô∏è Horizontal Scaling
Deploy multiple FastAPI instances behind a load balancer (e.g., NGINX, AWS ALB).

Each instance is stateless and can serve any request.

2Ô∏è Centralized Database
Migrate from SQLite to PostgreSQL/MySQL for concurrency.

Use connection pooling for efficient DB access.

Optionally add read replicas to distribute read load.

3Ô∏è Distributed Job Scheduling
Use APScheduler‚Äôs SQLAlchemyJobStore for shared scheduling state.

Alternatively, integrate Celery with Redis/RabbitMQ to distribute job execution across workers.

4Ô∏è API Rate Limiting and Security
Protect APIs with API key or JWT authentication.

Enforce rate limits per client.

Serve over HTTPS in production.

5Ô∏è Observability
Integrate structured logging (Loguru) and monitoring (Prometheus + Grafana).

Use centralized log aggregation for traceability.

6Ô∏è Containerization and Deployment
Package as Docker containers.

Orchestrate with Kubernetes for auto-scaling and failover.

üõ° API Management
Interactive Docs: FastAPI generates OpenAPI schema and Swagger UI at /docs.

Client SDKs: OpenAPI spec can be used to auto-generate client libraries.

Validation: All input data is validated using Pydantic.

Error Handling: Consistent JSON error responses with clear messages.
